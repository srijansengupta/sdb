IID simulationss: SDBmultreg.R is the R code for multiple regression simulations (Section 4.1), and SDB_logreg.R for logistic regression (Section 4.2). SDBplot.R is the R code for producing error plots from the output of the previous codes.

Time series simulations: SDBts_Mfun.R, SDBts_RegfunQ.R, tsregsimsQ.R, and Qsims.R have codes for performing the simulations, and SDBts_Manalysis.R has code for generating error plots.

Data analysis: The Central England Temperature dataset is in CentralEnglandTemperatures.txt and SDB_tsdata.R has R code for data analysis while SDB_Dataplot.R has R code for generating error plots.
